I have started creating a Virtual Pet Discord Bot to help me improve my Python skills and because, to be honest, I love Tamagotchis.

So far I have added a json file where players data will save, an adoption process for the pets including, feeding, playing and a help command.

I have been working extremely hard on this, and it has been challenging, but I will be adding the ability to pause/resume looking after your pet, the ability to rename your pet, and a hangout system so pets belonging to members of the same Discord server can hang out together. I also hope to add images/animations at some point.

*** A full README will be available soon explaining any changes and a roadmap ***
