I have started creating a Virtual Pet Discord Bot to help me improve my Python skills and because, to be honest, I love tamagotchi's

So far i have added a json file where players data will save, an adoption process for the pets including, feeding, playing and a help command

I have been working extremely hard on this and it has been challenging but I will be adding the ability to pause/resume looking after your pet; the ability to rename your pet; a hangout system so pets belonging to members of the same discord server can hangout together. I also hope to add images/animations at some point.

*** A full README will be avaliable soon explaning any changes and a roadmap ***
